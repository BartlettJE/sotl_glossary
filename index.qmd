# Overview {.unnumbered}

With the expanding nature of scholarship in Higher Education, having an agreed source of information to work from is helpful in facilitating communication and integration across diverse teams and disciplines who engage in scholarship. This glossary was generated with that idea in mind as part of the University of Glasgow Learning and Teaching Conference 2025 and as such contains a crowd-sourced collection of terms used in the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL).

This is a living document of an online, open access, collaborative compendium and will be updated at semi-regular intervals. Please feel free to contact the main editorial team of Drs Helena Paterson, Phil McAleer and James Bartlett if you wish to contribute or post as an issue on github.
