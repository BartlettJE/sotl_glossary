Accreditation,"A quality assurance and enhancement mechanism for programmes/courses by a relevant institution/external professional body, to ensure standards.","









","Accreditation can mean different things/be applied differently in different academic disciplines.  The [QAA website])https://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviewing-higher-education/degree-awarding-powers-and-university-title) gives more information about the general degree awarding powers that universities hold. Some schools/departments within a university will be accredited by an organisation (for example, the Adam Smith Business School at the University of Glasgow is accredited by AACSB, EQUIS, and AMBA), whereas in other areas, some degrees are accredited by professional bodies/organisations. This means that they are aligned with the professional body’s own qualifications and ensures that the education programme meets industry standards. Examples include the City Planning and Real Estate Msc degrees at the University of Glasgow are accredited by the [Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI)](http://www.rtpi.org.uk https://www.rtpi.org.uk/become-a-planner/study-at-university/wales-scotland-and-northern-ireland/) and the [Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors](https://www.rics.org https://www.rics.org/surveyor-careers/how-to-become-a-surveyor/university-surveying-courses) Other example include medicine and dentistry.","Joanna Stewart, Alison McCandlish",
Active Learning,Learning by doing and reflection; this could be individual or collaborative.,"Active learning is defined as “any instructional method that engages students in the learning process….[it] requires students to do meaningful activities and think about what they are doing” (prince, 2004, p.233, citing bonwell and eison 1991).









","Active learning can take place in any format, including online or in-person.  There is a large variety of methods and strategies that can be employed. e.g., team-based learning, think, pair, share and problem-based learning. Active learning supports various skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, communication and collaboration. Active learning facilitates deep learning vs superficial learning.",Vicki Dale,
Ai-Driven Adaptive Learning,Ai-driven systems provide a more personalised learning experience which cater to diverse learning preferences/requirements.,"Ai-driven adaptive learning enhances student engagement and performance, scaffolding individual learner pathways in real-time based on performance and preference. It requires technology to diagnose a starting point for learners in terms of their existing knowledge and skills. Subsequently upskilling them and continually monitoring their performance. The systems provide immediate feedback to the students, which informs their subsequent learning tasks.

Assessment,Method for evaluating learning and skills of learners,"Various methods for evaluating the learning that has taken place during a course, module or programme of study. Typically centered on demonstrating how the intended learning objectives of a course have been met, but also includes skills in communication that a student developed through a course









","While the goal is often to measure the attainment of learning objectives, something teachers forget to do is to align their assessment with those objectives or in other cases, the method of assessment can rely on a student needing to develop skills in communication that are assumed/not explicitly taught. The process of constructive alignment can help to align teaching methods and assessments with intended learning outcomes.",Helena Paterson,hidden curriculum; pedagogy

Epistemology,"Epistemology is the study of the nature of knowledge, how it is defined, what can be known, and what are its limits.","Epistemology is the study of the nature of knowledge, how it is defined, what can be known, and what are its limits.

Guba, e. S. and lincoln, y. S. (1994) ‘competing paradigms in qualitative research’, in denzin, n.k. & Lincoln, y.s. (eds.) Handbook of qualitative research. 2 ed. Thousand oaks, sage.

“Epistemology, according to the oxford english dictionary, is the theory or science of the method and ground of knowledge. It is a core area of philosophical study that includes the sources and limits, rationality and justification of knowledge.”

Stone, l. 2008. Epistemology. In given, l. (ed.) The sage encyclopedia of qualitative research methods. Thousand oaks.

“Branch of philosophy that investigates the possibility, origins, nature, and extent of human knowledge. Although the effort to develop an adequate theory of knowledge is at least as old as plato’s theaetetus, epistemology has dominated western philosophy only since the era of descartes and locke, as an extended dispute between rationalism and empiricism over the respective importance of a priori and a posteriori origins. Contemporary postmodern thinkers (including many feminist philosophers) have proposed the contextualization of knowledge as part of an intersubjective process.

“Defined narrowly, epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified belief. As the study of knowledge, epistemology is concerned with the following questions. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge? What are its sources? What is its structure, and what are its limits? As the study of justified belief, epistemology aims to answer questions such as how we are to understand the concept of justification? What makes justified beliefs justified? Is justification internal or external to one’s own mind? Understood more broadly, epistemology is about issues having to do with the creation and dissemination of knowledge in particular areas of inquiry.",,Nic Kipar,Methods

P-Value,"The probability of your data (or more extreme), assuming the null hypothesis is true.","Under frequentist inferential statistics, the p-value represents the probability of your data (or more extreme), assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Informally, you can see it as a measure of surprise, where a small p-value means your data would be surprising under the null. Conversely, a large p-value means your data would not be surprising under the null. The idea behind this technique is helping you make decisions where you can either reject the null or retain the null. Given an alpha value (often .05 or 5%), rejecting the null means you conclude there is an effect, whereas retaining the null means you do not conclude there is an effect.

Passive Learning,"In contrast to active learning, this term is associated with students being exposed to a predominantly an information transmission approach where they have no agency or investment in their learning.","Students cramming for a test may adopt a superficial approach to learning where the goal or motivation is to regurgitate with the purpose of passing an exam.
