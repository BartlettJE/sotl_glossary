## P-Value

<dfn>The probability of your data (or more extreme), assuming the null hypothesis is true.</dfn>

Long Definition: 

Under frequentist inferential statistics, the p-value represents the probability of your data (or more extreme), assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Informally, you can see it as a measure of surprise, where a small p-value means your data would be surprising under the null. Conversely, a large p-value means your data would not be surprising under the null. The idea behind this technique is helping you make decisions where you can either reject the null or retain the null. Given an alpha value (often .05 or 5%), rejecting the null means you conclude there is an effect, whereas retaining the null means you do not conclude there is an effect.

## Passive Learning

<dfn>In contrast to active learning, this term is associated with students being exposed to a predominantly an information transmission approach where they have no agency or investment in their learning.</dfn>

Long Definition: 

Students cramming for a test may adopt a superficial approach to learning where the goal or motivation is to regurgitate with the purpose of passing an exam.
