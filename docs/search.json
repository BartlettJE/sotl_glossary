This means that they are aligned with the professional body’s own qualifications and ensures that the education programme meets industry standards. Examples include the City Planning and Real Estate Msc degrees at the University of Glasgow are accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) and the Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors Other example include medicine and dentistry.\nContributors: Joanna Stewart, Alison McCandlish\nTags: NA",

There is a large variety of methods and strategies that can be employed. e.g., team-based learning, think, pair, share and problem-based learning. Active learning supports various skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, team-work, communication and collaboration. Active learning facilitates deep learning, vs superficial learning.\nContributors: Vicki Dale\nTags: NA",

It requires technology to diagnose a starting point for learners in terms of their existing knowledge and skills. Subsequently upskilling them and continually monitoring their performance. The systems provide immediate feedback to the students which informs their subsequent learning tasks.\nDeep Dive:\nNA\nContributors: Vicki Dale\nTags: NA",

Typically centered on demonstrating how the intended learning objectives of a course has been met, but also includes skills in communication that a student developed through a course\nDeep Dive:\nWhile the goal is often to measure the attainment of learning objectives, something teachers forget to do is to align their assessment with those objectives or in other cases the method of assessment can rely on a student needing to develop skills in communication that are assumed/not explicitly taught. The process of constructive alignment can help to align\nContributors: Helena Paterson\nTags: NA",
