The [QAA website])https://www.qaa.ac.uk/reviewing-higher-education/degree-awarding-powers-and-university-title) gives more information about the general degree awarding powers that universities hold. Some schools/departments within a university will be accredited by an organisation (for example, the Adam Smith Business School at the University of Glasgow is accredited by AACSB, EQUIS, and AMBA), whereas in other areas, some degrees are accredited by professional bodies/organisations. This means that they are aligned with the professional body’s own qualifications and ensures that the education programme meets industry standards. Examples include the City Planning and Real Estate Msc degrees at the University of Glasgow are accredited by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI) and the Royal Institute for Chartered Surveyors Other example include medicine and dentistry.\nContributors: Joanna Stewart, Alison McCandlish\nTags: NA",

S. and lincoln, y. S. (1994) ‘competing paradigms in qualitative research’, in denzin, n.k. & Lincoln, y.s. (eds.) Handbook of qualitative research. 2 ed. Thousand oaks, sage.\n“Epistemology, according to the oxford english dictionary, is the theory or science of the method and ground of knowledge. It is a core area of philosophical study that includes the sources and limits, rationality and justification of knowledge.”\nStone, l. 2008. Epistemology. In given, l. (ed.) The sage encyclopedia of qualitative research methods. Thousand oaks.\n“Branch of philosophy that investigates the possibility, origins, nature, and extent of human knowledge. Although the effort to develop an adequate theory of knowledge is at least as old as plato’s theaetetus, epistemology has dominated western philosophy only since the era of descartes and locke, as an extended dispute between rationalism and empiricism over the respective importance of a priori and a posteriori origins. Contemporary postmodern thinkers (including many feminist philosophers) have proposed the contextualization of knowledge as part of an intersubjective process.\n“Defined narrowly, epistemology is the study of knowledge and justified belief. As the study of knowledge, epistemology is concerned with the following questions. What are the necessary and sufficient conditions of knowledge? What are its sources? What is its structure, and what are its limits? As the study of justified belief, epistemology aims to answer questions such as how we are to understand the concept of justification? What makes justified beliefs justified? Is justification internal or external to one’s own mind? Understood more broadly, epistemology is about issues having to do with the creation and dissemination of knowledge in particular areas of inquiry.\nDeep Dive:\nNA\nContributors: Nic Kipar\nTags: Methods",

Informally, you can see it as a measure of surprise, where a small p-value means your data would be surprising under the null. Conversely, a large p-value means your data would not be surprising under the null. The idea behind this technique is helping you make decisions where you can either reject the null or retain the null.
